# Driver-Drowisness-Detection
This driver drowsiness detection model is machine learning project focusing on solving the problem of number of road accidents caused by exhausted drivers. A camera on the dashboard in front of the driver will detect if the eyes of the driver are closed or semi-closed for more than a second, hence eliminating the difference of a blink, and sounding the alarm to alert the driver and urging to take a break for safe and happy travelling!
The project uses Python as the primary language. The most important libraries used are Tensorflow, Keras, cv2, pickle, winsound, numpy, pandas and os. The dataset used for the training and testing is the open source MRL Dataset (http://mrl.cs.vsb.cz/eyedataset). The model uses the Transfer Learning method and takes the already implemented model MobileNet from the Keras (Tensorflow) library. The primary reason behind choosing this dataset was the efficiency it offers. The model does it work pretty well with an acceptable accuracy.
